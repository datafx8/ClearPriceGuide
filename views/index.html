        <article>
            <p>With healthcare costs expected to rise in the next year, here are eight ways to save on healthcare costs:</p>
            
            <h2>1. Don't Wait — Make a Plan Ahead of Time</h2>
            
            <p>Trying to make decisions in the middle of sickness or an emergency will cost you. That is not the time where good judgement and thoughtful decisions emerge. Instead make a plan now for how you will approach health care. Don't wait, start now by following the steps below.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Choose the Best Option for Care</h2>
            
            <p>Plan ahead for when, under what circumstances, and where you will receive care. The chart below shows the differences in the cost of care by type of visit. Selecting the right option for care can save hundreds to thousands of dollars.</p>
            
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
                <thead>
                    <tr style="background: #f5f5f5;">

                        <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">$1,200 - $4,500</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>Going to the emergency room with the symptoms of a cold, while an exaggeration, obviously will cost you thousands but note the small variances in cost between going to your primary physician versus a virtual visit — the savings is hundreds of dollars per visit.</p>
            
            <p>This <a href="https://www.uhc.com/member-resources/where-to-go-for-medical-care/care-options-and-costs" target="_blank">website from United Healthcare</a> does a great job of breaking down care options.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Shop for the Best Prices with High Quality</h2>
            
            <p>You wouldn't buy a car without knowing the price and checking the quality of your purchase — why should the care you receive be any different? It is not always true that the higher the price the better the quality.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Check Prices?</h3>
            
            <p>Healthcare providers are required to provide a transparent list of the cost for services. You can locate these by going to the provider's website and searching for transparency or for links to pricing under the billing department.</p>
            
            <h3>How Can I Compare Across Providers?</h3>
            
            <p>Many health insurance plans provide tools to help you compare costs and quality. Check with your insurance provider's site to see if they provide assistance. Medicare provides a tool that may also be helpful for comparison: <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/" target="_blank">Find Healthcare Providers: Compare Care Near You | Medicare</a></p>
            
            <h3>Is There a Way I Can Compare Costs Myself?</h3>
            
            <p>It can be a little complicated but here's how I do it. The pricing tables use a common procedure code CPT. While this will not give an exact cost of care, they can tell you how the provider is positioning care either higher or lower in cost. Here are some common CPT codes you can use for comparison. To save time just pick the lowest number which typical is the least level of care needed and compare.</p>
            
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
                <thead>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">Emergency Care (level of care)</td>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">99281-99283</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">Basic Blood Draw</td>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">36415</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>Note that urgent care facilities may use the same codes as primary care but they will be listed by the urgent care clinic vs. the primary care physician. Also, it's important to determine how basic service like a blood draw are billed and the price, other procedures can be found and compared but this is a good start.</p>
            
            <p>Also often times, the prices listed will be for a specific insurance or self-pay, depending on your specifics, compare using the insurance you have or look at the self-pay price.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Check for Quality?</h3>
            
            <p>Again your insurance provider may provide quality metrics that help here, check with your insurance provider and read reviews for that provider. Another great resource is <a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/" target="_blank">HealthGrades.com</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Choose In-Network Providers / Check for a Self-Pay Discount</h2>
            
            <p>If you're insured check that all of the provider's you will see are covered by your insurance provider. Check your insurance provider to ensure the physician you are seeing is covered as well as any labs or diagnostics. Eligibility changes so even if you've been going to a physician for a while double check that are still covered by the insurer prior to receiving services.</p>
            
            <p>If you don't have insurance or are underinsured, check with the billing office on any self-pay discounts. Often times this is listed on the billing page.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Understand Your Insurance Plan</h2>
            
            <p>There are a variety of plans and there's not time to cover them all here. Check your insurance plan for the amount you are responsible to pay. Some basics to be aware of:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Co-Pay</strong> — an amount you are responsible to pay for each visit (e.g. $25 co-pay)</p>
            
            <p><strong>% Share</strong> — some plans pay only up to a certain amount per visit or require you to pay percentage</p>
            
            <p><strong>Deductible</strong> — often this is an amount per individual or per family on an annual basis that you must pay before insurance will pay their part.</p>
            
            <p>If you are paying, it might be time to shop around for a new insurance plan that fits your need.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Use Your Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>
            
            <p>If you are among the many americans with an HSA, take advantage of the triple tax savings by paying for all of your out-of-pocket medical expenses using your HSA.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Review Your Bill and Negotiate</h2>
            
            <p>Billing practices vary based on the provider and they are not always accurate. Here's what you can do:</p>
            
            <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Be Patient</strong> — billing can take some time.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Wait to Pay</strong> until insurance is processed.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Review your bill</strong></li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>If it seems high</strong>, contact your insurance first and seek to understand. Often times insurers will work on your behalf to resolve billing problems - ask them to help.

                        <li>What code was used and is that right?</li>
                        <li>Is the amount correct, based on the prices provided?</li>
                        <li>If you can ask to pay co-pays, deductible, and your share after insurance has been billed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Contact the provider billing office.</strong> Be nice. Ask for an explanation and compare to what your insurance payer stated.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Negotiate</strong> — if the price charged is different than the price submitted, ask why and if the price listed on their website can be used? Ask what the self-pay price would be — sometimes the price of self-pay would be less than you pay with insurance. Ask if there is a financial plan where you can pay part over time.</li>
